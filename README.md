### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Max, I'm a Software Developer. I stubbornly use VS Code in VIM mode, I love the command line and couldn't live without tmux or zsh. I miss the days of SSHing into production servers and updating the live site, however I've been able to live with satisfaction in building great CI/CD system.

I've written lots of code, for lots of different reasons, in lots of different languages, some highlights have been

- Engineering a common build and deploy system, then rolling it out to dozens of teams and applications
- Hitting a 95% cache offload and keeping backend servers alive during a 400% growth period in the peak of COVID
- Building widgets, Apps and custom firmware for branded Android handsets
- Developing an auto-healing, auto-deploying, auto-scaling kubernetes infrastructure

These days I write less code and spend more time working with Product Managers to build Story Maps, Flowcharts, Documentation and project plans. Basically, my job is to remove any roadblocks that would normally get in a developers way.

My personal website - (maxlew.is)[https://maxlew.is] - is a little bit of a joke at the moment. But when I'm looking for work again you'll be able to find my resume there.
